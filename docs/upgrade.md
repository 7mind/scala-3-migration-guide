# Full upgrade to Scala 3

Scala 2 is binary compatible with Scala 3. It means that you can migrate your application one module at a time. It also means that you can try those exciting new features without blocking anyone. Prior to this you will need your build tool to handle multiple Scala versions, that is not something that every build tool can do though. Otherwise you will have to port your application all at once.
